    <p>Captain America, whose real name is Steve Rogers, was born in the early 1900s and was a scrawny little dude who wanted to fight in World War II. The army told him no countless times because of his stature. A scientist doing an experiment with a serum that could give someone superhuman abilities took Steve under his wing and the serum worked, and he was finally able to go to war. He fought and came face to face with the mastermind behind the German weapons army, Red Skull. He defeated Red Skull, but became stuck on a flying ship in the Arctic Tundra in the process, and was buried for 70 years. He wakes up and meets Nick Fury, the leader of SHIELD, and becomes the avenger we know and love today.
